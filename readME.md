An app that makes calls to the National Providers Identifier API based on user search. React.js was used for the frontend, useState, and useEffect update the search results dynamically. I used Node.js for the backend to
make the calls to the API adding in the user search terms. Axios was used to grab the data from the API into useable json, I also used localStorage to save the search url so that the useEffect could display the results.

This was a challenging project since I do not have a lot of experience sending data from React to Node.js, I looked up a lot of documentation and watched quite a few YouTube videos on this topic.
